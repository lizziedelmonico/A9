# A9
In all honesty, I am very ashamed of my performance on this assignment. Although I wasn't able to complete nearly as much as I wanted to, it's worth acknowledging the fact that despite my best efforts to avoid it, I have the flu. Since I haven't been able to attend Office Hours, TA Hours, or even class, there was not a big chance of this assignment getting completed. Since I've already used up two of my extension days, I'm "taking the L" on this assignment in hopes that the terrible score will get removed. I do, however, plan on revisiting this assignment before the semester ends (hopefully when I'm not very sick) because I was very excited about this when it was first announced in class.
